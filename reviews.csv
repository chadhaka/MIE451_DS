If you look out of the windows on an angle to the right, you might glimpse the water. Be prepared for stairs! Breakfast included some hot menu items. It was different in that you have to stop by the front desk for a breakfast voucher and then proceed to the on site restaurant. There were a limited amount of items from which to choose and only given one egg -- looks like small when scrambled. In fact, all portions were small for a big appetite. The gym had a funky smell so we avoided it. It needs better circulation. The kids liked the pool because it had balls and pool noodles to add to the fun.

After checking trip adviser and the availability of several hotels in the area we decided on Quality Inn. We got a great deal for staying 2 nights.  The website listed a mini fridge as an amenity in the rooms so we brought food in a cooler to save some money and were quite disappointed to find that our room did not have a fridge.  We did like the courtyard and enjoyed a picnic supper out there. The kids couldn't wait to get to the pool. I found the water cold so I sat and watched the kids play. There were a couple boys soccer and baseball teams staying at the hotel for the night and a bunch of the boys were in the pool that night and were being very rowdy, the adults with them did not stop them. There were no towels in the pool area.  For Breakfast you have to stop at the front desk and get vouchers to take to the restaurant, they give you a menu and you are able to pick 1 item from one section and 2 items from the other section, coffee and tea are included but milk and juice are extra which they dont tell you until after you ask for it. My husband picked the sausages (you get 2), egg (you only get 1) and home fries, they sent it out on an oval plate and it looked so empty I thought he was going to cry. He only got half the amount of fries that our 7 year old got (about a handful).The waitress came and gave him a second cup of coffee but I wasn't ready for more yet, then when I was ready I couldn't get her attention. It did seem quite busy though. Our second night at the hotel the pool wasn't very busy, still no towels though, I had to get some from the fitness room. Monday morning the restaurant wasn't as busy. My husband ordered what our son had the day before (fish cake, pancakes and home fries) and was a bit more full after eating. We had a different waitress. She was quite friendly but when she came around refilling coffee she poured my husband's and walked away and I couldn't get her attention to tell her I wanted more.

My only complaint is you have to pay for the coffee -- which should be included :-) We had a few minor issues initially which I reported to the front desk and then later to the GM Trevor M who took our issues very personally and quickly rectified the problems. We were graciously compensated for being locked out of your room the 2nd last night (had to move rooms)  The front desk staff need a bit of polishing in customer service skills but all in all the hotel is easy to find/clean and obviously the GM takes complaints very seriously.

My wife and I were looking to get married at home in Cape Breton but had a really tough time finding the right venue. We had already consulted with Chef Ardon Moffard of Governors Pub and Eatery about catering and were excited by the menu choice. Upon his suggestion we took a look at the Hearthstone's venue spaces and immediately saw the potential. We planned the dinner in the courtyard outside in the open air, and a party and dance in the ballroom. I have to say that working with Ardon and his staff was such a great experience and really took away so much of the stress of planning a wedding. From our dinner menu, to drink selection, the work they did on the outside bar, our decorator Maureen Barrington who works very close with the event staff it all worked out so well. We had some specific things we wanted to have for the event and no job was really too small. The guests had a great time, and for the amount of people we had either indoors dancing and listening to the bands that played, or sitting out under the stars drinking local craft brewed beer, we were told by SO MANY people that it was easily the best wedding they had ever gone to. If you are planning a wedding in Sydney I'd highly recommend this venue with this staff. Governors runs a good ship and they've done a great job turning this space in to a go to spot for Sydney.",5,positive

The front desk staff made us feel like we were imposing on them; although they did apologize. We moved to the 3 floor and went to get the rest of our luggage. We (including my 12yr old) had to walk through a cloud of marijuana smoke as a gentleman smoked his joint right in front of the front entrance. When we mentioned it to the front desk staff they just shrugged. After settling in the room I noticed dried urine right in front of the toilet( I have a photo to prove) it was disgusting. The hotel was hosting two basketball teams but even with all this business they refused to provide a free breakfast to more than 2 people per room. Considering most of the team ate dinner twice in the restaurant a free child's breakfast isn't much to ask. Our team children wanted to swim in the evening and because the hotel was renovating there was construction materials, large windows and stacks of unpacked flooring all over the halls by the pool. This is a huge liability if one of those children were to get injured( we instructed them to stay clear of it) during our stay we were forced to walk through marijuana and cigarette smoke at both entrances. The staff did not seem to be bothered to enforce their no smoking sign. When getting ready to leave I always check under the bed as kids tend to leave things behind. There were dried up Timbits under the bed! It was quite evident that the hotel is not cleaned properly.

The hotel is clean with the amenities you'd expect of a hotel in this price range (roughly CDN$150 / night). Service was courteous and efficient.

Free Internet access was included. The indoor pool was in good condition and well maintained.  The location is convenient to downtown Sydney (not that there's much there, but still). We stayed here because we needed to catch the ferry to Newfoundland the next day. The ferry is about 7-10 miles from the hotel.  On the negative side, if you're on the side close to the road, you will get some road noise at night. It didn't bother me, but I can imagine it might bother some. Also, the front parking lot is in decent condition, but the rear parking lot is gravel. I've found a lot of gravel roads and gravel parking lots in Nova Scotia, so not unusual, I suppose.

Found a Summer Sizzler Deal that included steak or chicken dinner for each night of reservation, free parking and a one bedroom suite for $159. What a deal we thought. The reviews online for this hotel were pretty good, so we thought what could possibly not be as advertised.  To start, the hotel parking would have been $2 a day with only 2 sides fenced in with an arm for a gate that required a parking card. One side was completely open to the boardwalk/water side where anyone could come right in. Oh yeah, and the so-called advertised boardwalk was a walkway along the water...very short...that went in front of about 3 hotels and a parking lot. no shops, no restaurants, no pubs, no reason to be out there. The hotel was in downtown Sydney, but what most people do not realize is there is absolutely nothing to walk to or do in Sydney. No attractions, no events, etc. We don't understand why people would come here. We actually stayed here because it was about an hour away from Louisborg Fort, which is why we stayed here.  The hotel itself was relatively clean, but looked old. The hallway and actual rooms reminded you of a creepy, old extended stay with dark , musty hallways and funky smells in the rooms. Very cheaply done with mismatched furniture.  The deal for the Steak and Chicken Dinner consisted of telling the front desk which type of dinner we would like and then..are you ready for this?....we had to find the roof of the hotel, which was not marked by signs for the roof, but for signs for the Fitness Center..and then find our way out the roof...yes, the roof...find one of two gas grills that worked and make our own steak and chicken. I have to admit, they gave us a huge container of fresh slices of pepper, zucchini, onion, broccoli, and two baked potatoes and a large Delmonico steak and half a chicken. (The potatoes were cooked for us, everything else we had to treck up the roof to cook on the gas grill ourselves). Oh, almost forgot, both nights they brought us our food to cook, it was raining, so not only did we have to cook our own dinners while on vacation, but we had to cook them outside in the pouring rain! (Oh, and they brought a temperature probe to use, but forgot to put batteries in it making is useless).   The housekeeper did not take the tray of the dirty dishes from our room from the previous night and what we thought was really odd was that there was a small kitchenette with refrigerator and sink, and microwave, but no paper towels, no dish liquid, no dish rag, etc. There also was no hand soap given and we had to wash our hands with body soap as that I all they gave you.  I just realized, the hotel said they accepted pets on all floors except the floor we booked, but I could swear that weird smell in the rooms was from pets...who knows?  The complimentary breakfast was pathetic! They have their own restaurant, but all they offered you for breakfast was bagels, bread, and dry cereal. They had tea, coffee, and orange juice.  The place looked like it had not been remodeled from when it was built back in the 70's , 80's...not nice and chique like the photos reflect.  I am sure there are other hotels to stay in than this one, but perhaps do your research better than we did and pick a place where at least you can walk or drive to something to do.

Today, we arrived in Sydney after a five-hour drive from Halifax.

The room rate is $169 per night,"" before walking away saying that ""We obviously can't come to a resolution"". At no point did he or his staff make ANY effort to compromise or see if there was anything they could do for us; they simply repeated the rate and stared at us, waiting for us to pay.  At this point, I went to my phone and placed a call to the number on the website, stating that I wanted to make a complaint about the manager. The woman sounded surprised but agreed to put me through to the General Manager. I got a voicemail and left a message with Michele, the GM.  At this point, Doug returned and continued to smirk and repeat the same line about that being the rate. At no point did ANYONE try to make a compromise or make any effort to make it right-- they simply repeated the price and waited. Though we explained that a mistake had been made on THEIR end and that good customer service would dictate that they should honor their mistake, they insisted that it must have been a mistake on our end and the rate would stand. The only thing they offered was to take off the $7/day parking rate.  When I mentioned to Doug that I had called to make a complaint about him, he smirked and said ""I know-- you called OUR reservation desk"". He clearly had NO fear or worry about my complaint against him.  Ultimately, he brought out a woman named Heather who explained, once again, that the rate would stand. She then offered to call and make a reservation for us at a competing hotel if we weren't willing to pay the rate. So, we're paying $200/night for a bland, crowded, double hotel room.  I sure hope Cambridge Suites needed that extra $300 per night, because it's not like we did. Ultimately, the thing I'm most upset about is the way we were treated and the fact that they were COMPLETELY unwilling to make any compromises or concessions whatsoever. The WORST customer service experience I've EVER had and I'll never spend another cent at Cambridge Suites.",1,negative

I was staying here while attending a banquet with my graduating class. After the banquet all of our rooms were in close proximity to each other and we were all going back and forth to rooms and ended up staying in my room to chat and have a couple of drinks. We did not have any music playing and the TV was on mute with a hockey game on. Throughout the night we heard of other rooms that were receiving noise complaints but my room did not received one single knock at the door. Around 2:30am five police officers and one of the hotel “auditors” knocked at my door and asked to speak to me. I was then notified that I was being evicted from the hotel. I have stayed at many hotels with sports teams in the past and understand that if there are noise complaints that your can be kicked out of the hotel but I had not received one warning from the hotel staff throughout the night. This was absolutely ridiculous and humiliating. The next day when I went in to speak with one of the managers about the situation she stated that the auditors stated that they were at my room multiple times and warned me about the noise complaints. A couple of days later I received a call from the hotel stating that I had to pay the bill for my room and that I was basically a liar because the auditors said they did go to my room multiple times although they did not speak one word to me the whole night. Overall the hotel is beautiful and the restaurant is amazing but, I would never recommend this hotel strictly because of their poor customer service skills.",1,negative

Three out of four mornings we arrived to empty containers, no dishes or cutlery. Imagine so many people just standing there waiting for terrible food when it arrived and the front entrance and lobby lined up with customers waiting somewhat patiently for their free breakfast. No staff member seem concerned or even attempted to offer explanation. I'm not really understanding how such a well known hotel as this can offer such poor service to it's paying customers.

The hotel is nice with pleasant staff and nice facilities, plus the location on the Sydney waterfront is tremendous. However, there were some issues. I booked a suite with two double beds yet the beds were actually 3/4 beds (48"" wide)! Had our party been four adults, we would have had to change rooms, which probably wouldn't have been possible since I believe the hotel was fully booked. In addition, the suite was showing some signs of lack of maintenance with wallpaper peeling off in the bathroom. Otherwise the suite was fine.  My only other problem was upon checkout the bill was $10 higher for the first night the on my reservation. I pointed this out to the girl at the front desk, who then processed what she said was a $10 refund. However, afterwards, I checked this and discovered she'd in fact added the amount and not refunded. I asked another clerk to fix this and he did so promptly. I really don't understand why the additional charge was there in the first place unless the Cambridge's reservation system is not working properly. I might add that during my Maritime vacation, I stayed in several hotels, a couple of which were higher level spots than the Cambridge Suites and all of them offered free parking whereas the Cambridge Suites charged $7/night. Were they offering indoor parking at that rate I could understand, but it was simply an outdoor parking lot beside the hotel.",3,negative

However, there are several areas that could be improved on.  Constantly ran out of coffee at breakfast. Coffee cups hold about 3 swallows, so second cup needed, but often wasn't any coffee to be had. Otherwise, breakfast was really good, with lots of choices.  Rooms need to be thoroughly cleaned. Dust on furniture and dirt on carpet. Furnishing dirty and worn; need replacing. Curtains couldn't be opened; neither could windows. Fridge either froze things solid, or didn't keep them cold.  Shower has great water pressure, but too much for the tub drain to handle. So a 10 minute shower resulted in standing in ankle deep water. Tub was old and stained, and the shower curtain wasn't waterproof, so puddles of water ended up on the bathroom floor.  For an hotel to call itself an 'extended stay' hotel, I would expect a few things in the room. Place setting for 4 (only had 2), dishtowel, dish soap, etc would be expected. Otherwise, I would have to either pack them, or buy them and leave them in the hotel.  Given my experience here (8 days), I would be tempted to try somewhere else",3,negative

The Saturday morning, I was extremely sick from something I had to ate the night before so I had my boyfriend call down to the front desk to see if there was any possible way to extend the checkout time or even pay to do so. The receptionist at the front desk had told him that we were able to stay until 2pm (one extra hour). When 1pm came, I had realized that I only gotten worse with time and needed more time to sleep and hopefully be okay to drive back to Halifax. When my boyfriend called to the desk again to see if there was ANY way to extend the checkout time, even just a few hours and the reply was ""no"" and we would have to purchase the room for an additional night. Being as sick as I was we had to agree, because I could barely move, let alone pack up and drive 4.5 hours home.   After a couple hours of sleeping when I woke up around 5:30, I had felt a little better and thought that it must had passed out of my system and now I was just very weak but was able to move around and get out of bed. We called down to the front desk again and told them the situation and were hoping to check out, and even pay half of what the second night would have cost us. Unfortunately, the receptionist was extremely rude and told us that if we had called 30 minutes ago, we could have paid $50 for something they call a ""day stay"".   WELL would have been great to know that about 5 hours ago when we called and asked for that EXACT thing. I am extremely unimpressed with the service on such a well known hotel. On top of all this, I was charged for drinking a bottle of wine that was never even touched. I will not be returning back to any of the Cambridge Suite Hotels and BE WARNED if you are planning to stay here! Make sure nothing happens to you/or get sick, because people are people and sometimes bad things happen that no one can prevent! (but the Cambridge Suite Hotel staff are super human and don't have any compassion/understanding when bad things happen that we have no self-control over)   ALSO: After knowing that we were going to have to stay for the second night, we had asked to have housekeeping because we had gotten the note under our door stating if we would like house keeping to call before 3pm, but the card was time stamped 3:15... to late to call! They sounded confused after asking for the housekeeping and asked ""well what do you need done..?"" As if they did not know what house keeping was... fresh sheets/linens, cleaning up the room, garbage changed, etc. Well after telling them what we wanted done, they sent a guest service member up and they had just changed the bed, thats it.

The front desk staff were very helpful and provided us with restaurant details etc. The only let down was the breakfast area. The food was just average and very, very expensive. With that exception I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Sydney area.",4,positive

Great restaurants in the hotel with reasonably priced food. My preference was the Crown & Moose, as they offered great pub fare and awesome free live entertainment on the Sat night! The older gentleman that works there was fabulous with my Mom! He was attentive, and took her soup out right away before my meal, which I appreciated. Wish I could have gotten his name, as I think he should be recognized by the management as a staff member that truly cares about his customers. Breakfast in SaltSpray was good. They have a great buffet breakfast for $18.95. The view is awesome from this restaurant. Rooms were fairly quiet, with the exception of a few stragglers making their way to their room at 2am (which is to be expected on a Sat night, I guess). Well lit,free parking/ elevators/ decent in room coffee/ friendly front desk staff. All in all, a great place to stay, I will definitely return!

The restaurant (SaltSprays) I have not eaten in although their breakfast deals are reasonable yet it also depends where in Cape Breton you have to go and stay.

I totally enjoy my stays at this property and this is the first time I have formally written a review of it.   First of all, the location is the best spot in Sydney if you are going to focus on taking in the sights and sounds of the city. It is within easy walking distance of most attractions on the waterfront and has direct access to the boardwalk lining the harbour where special events mostly happen. The government wharf is just a short stroll away and includes the information centre for the city and Cape Breton Island along with the cruise ship docking facility. Some hotel harbour views have a great bird’s eye view of the comings and goings of the cruise ships and other traffic that come into port.   The hotel is a full service hotel with a pub, restaurant and fitness facility. The food is good and staff providing the food and beverage services are friendly and fun to chat with. The pool has a slide, whirlpool and the water is kept at a nice warm temperature. I especially appreciated this since a lot of hotels don’t heat the pool and whirlpool adequately enough and freezing pool water is a real challenge for the especially young and/or aging seniors to enjoy so I rate this very highly. All rooms have a view of the harbour to some extent with some having superior and awesome panoramic views. I always pay a bit extra to get the best views and highly recommend this for your stay.   The rooms are a nice size and come with an empty small bar refrigerator for bottled water, drinks, medicines, etc. you may need to refrigerate along with a Keurig coffee maker. The restaurant will provide real milk creamers if you ask them and you can store them in the fridge. I dislike the edible oil creamers that are supplied in the room. The supplied toiletries are a nice surprise as I actually enjoy using them. The king sized bed and linens were very comfortable as well and I enjoyed an excellent sleep.   The check in and out was quick and special thanks to Philippa who took care of my front desk transactions. She was friendly, engaging and informative. Many thanks it was greatly appreciated and again thank you for telling me that the parade was on the morning of the check out so I made sure I didn’t get blocked in when leaving for the airport.",4,positive

I find that housekeeping can be improved, as they are slow getting to the rooms. Every other service is well done. I was here in the Spring and Summer and I find that since there's a pool here, it's super family-friendly which can translate into noise. I had a issue with a hockey team who was in town and the ""parents"" were nowhere to be found. I called Guest Services to complain about the noise and they were on it - sent security around the building to round up the little hooligans - and right at 11 it was completely quiet. They do everything they can to keep this old building up to snuff. Really pretty view of the harbour and right on the boardwalk.",4,positive

This was one of the nicest hotels of our trip (after the Hilton St. John, and maybe the Lord Beaverbrook in Fredericton), but it was certainly our most expensive for the second night at over $200 with tax! I've stayed at a lot of Hampton Inns, and this is the nicest one in which I've stayed. If I didn't factor price/value in my ratings, I would have given in 5 dots, because this is a Hampton Inn on steroids! I wouldn't have coughed up the money without the free night, though. The lobby is impressive with a beautiful stone fireplace and artwork, and a grand staircase. The pool has an adequate size and a great slide which doesn't dump into the pool (making the pool usable for others). They have taken care of the pool heating problem which a prior reviewer had noted--the temperature was quite comfortable. It has the largest and best-equipped gym I've ever seen in a Hampton Inn, and everything in perfect order. Unlike many Hamptons, the breakfast area is very ample in size, with no danger of over-crowding. The rooms are expansive, quiet and comfortable. Ther's a flat HD television, and the internet worked well and promptly. Although the hotel has no restaurant for lunch or dinner, it is connected to a good one at the trade and convention center via a climate-controlled walkway. We had some problems with the GPS locating this property, probably because it's new, but even putting in the trade and convention center led to problems.  In short, I have nothing to complain about this property but the price, which I would expect more of a luxury property. I realize Canada is expensive, but this property was more expensive than the Hilton St. John or the Crowne Plaza/Lord Beaverbrook in Fredericton. Do spend a day at Louisbourg Fortress!",4,positive

The hot breakfast that is included is somewhat normal fare, but there was enough that I was able to try different things each day. The hotel is connected via elevated pedway to a convention centre with a very good restaurant, which made evening dining easy -- especially if you have arrived without a car. The only drawback, the wireless and wired internet connection, at least in my room, was fine for my iPad but very slow for my laptop and maintaining a VPN connection was difficult.

Decorated beautifully, this hotel is very much a step up from other hotels in its price range. Check in went very quickly and smoothly and the attendants at the front desk were very friendly and helpful.  Our room was spacious, very comfortable, very clean, and very quiet. Not only was the bathroom large and had enough shelf space under the counter to accommodate toiletries for 4 people, but there was also a little kitchenette just outside the bathroom with a fridge, microwave, and even a sink and paper towels. Perfect for a family of 4 with 2 teens so we don't all have to fight for the bathroom. The pool is a typical hotel pool, but it is very clean and has a waterslide which we all enjoyed. The towel area is checked regularly, so they never ran out. We were disappointed to find out there is no hot tub, though. After a long drive, a good soak in a hot tub would have been perfect to sooth travel-weary muscles, but honestly, I think that is my only complaint about this hotel. Breakfast here was easily the best hotel breakfast we have ever had, and we have stayed at a lot of hotels over the years. Every morning, there was a different variety of meats and eggs, such as western omelettes, scrambled with ham & cheese, or just plan eggs, sausage, or ham. There was also several choices of fruit, pastries and breads, waffles, hot porridge as well as cold cereals. The serving room is separate from the dining area, so there was always lots of room for everyone and the attendant was very good at keeping up with the food so it was rare to have to wait for anything.  The hotel is joined to the convention center via a covered walkway from the second floor. We didn't use this, but there were a few wedding receptions there during our stay and we saw several people using this, which would be ideal in poor weather. What makes this hotel even better is the fact that it was only a few dollars more than the other hotels in the area, but a huge difference in ambiance, service, and amenities.

Result: my father had to sleep on the floor (and even if the hotel was clean, carpeted hotel floors are not known to be very sanitary). Also, four out of five of us got very sick...we really believe that we ate something bad during breakfast because it was that afternoon that I started getting sick (I only got better about 30 hours later) and then my family did too. Though the breakfast was good and had the best variety, it is the only meal we had that day before all getting sick and I don't think it was a coincidence. Beware of the sausage, especially.

We booked a junior suite online and when we arrived we were told they don't have that kind of room. We told them it was what we booked on an outside website and they told us they knew it was an option, but didn't have any room that really matched it. We booked the room because the online description said it had a living room and kitchenette and we had an infant with us.   I'm not sure why they would allow people to book a room that doesn't exist.  When we got in our room the toilet was clogged, and they told us no one was available to come fix it. We asked if they had a plunger and they said we could come to the desk and get it. I find it hard to believe they let guests unclog a toilet. I can't believe there was literally not one person in the hotel who could take care of that for a guest.   We went to the restaurant for dinner and they got both of our orders wrong. We asked for no peppers on a stir fry and it came full of peppers, when we told them we had ordered no peppers, the waitress argued with us and said we didn't ask for no peppers. She said, did you want a new one or can you just pick them out? We ordered a club sandwich on whole wheat and it came on white. We sent it back and the next one came with BURNT toast. I'm talking black. When we asked the waitress why she would bring this she said, ""I don't make the food I just bring it.""  They tried to charge us $10 a night for our infant even though their website clearly says children under 12 stay free.

We stayed for two nights at the hotel in a beautiful room over looking the golf course and sea. The resort is the highest level of service, quality and views on Cape Breton and maybe all of Nova Scotia.   Dinner:   Our dinner consisted of a delicious mussles to start and flank steak, lobster (what else?!) ravioli, which were all made of the freshest ingredients and prepared perfectly. While eating dinner we saw a spectacular sunset (its amazing how fast the sun sets just before dusk - the sun moved the width of the sun in approximately 5 minutes).   Golf:  In the spirit of a true links course this is right on the ocean where high winds prevail, fescue is thick as hell and you never find a flat lie. I'd say this was one of the most beautiful courses I've ever played, unequivocally. There is even one hole that abuts a small in-land harbour. By next year I predict this course will rank in the top twenty in Canada in Golf Magazine.   Hotel:  ALL of the rooms look over the course and sea, which is the star of the show. The hotel is designed to be minimalist from the outside so that it blends in with the dunes and fescue that surrounds it. Our room was beautifully appointed with the highest end finishings and a very comfortable bed.   The entire resort is perfect for a high end corporate retreat or a romantic golf getaway (which was what we did). Enjoy Cabot Links as soon as possible.

First the rooms, they were very comfortable, cable TV, wireless internet, and reasonably large. All the rooms overlook the golf course. The staff at the resort could not be more helpful. If you had a question/problem, they fixed it. I agree with Nancy H about this not being a fancy resort. Rooms, food, and golf, I can live on that. I had dinner in the restaurant one night and it was five stars. Great wine and great food. The breakfasts were also excellent. As for the golf course, it has been opened for 3 months and you would think it has been opened for a year. The course was visually stunning and a tought test of golf. Bring lots of golf balls because if you get off the very generous fairways, you're not going to find the ball (small schrubs and thick grass). The greens are huge, smooth, and look dangerously fast but are very slow (8 on the stimp). It plays more like an Irish links type of course where bump and run is a common shot (leave the L wedge home). According to the pro, as they get more mature, they will speed them up. In the morning the winds were blowing about 15 MPH and that made it all the more challenging. In the PM, the wind died down. When I made the reservations, I made all my tee times. We changed our date by 1 day and they were very accomodating making the changes to the roooms and our tee times. All in all this was a wonderful experience and it won't be long before the course is in the top 50 in the world.",5,positive

I haven't been to Scotland, but I'm told they compare favorably with Scottish links courses.  The resort itself is pretty spartan. Our room was very modern and comfortable. There is only one restaurant, but it's offerings were good. Except one night there was a power outage, which we were told was not that uncommon. It lasted hours. There isn't anything else to do in Inverness.   The magnet is the golf courses. They are beautiful and challenging. Don't expect pristine conditions; the climate isn't conducive to groomed fairways and manicured greens. You go there for the experience. We played Cabot Cliffs the month after it opened. The conditions were far from ideal. The greens were hardly greens. No matter, the design and views make every step worthwhile.   The courses are walking only. You can rent a cart or provide your own. Caddies must be ordered in advance. For the best experience get a caddie.   We were told that a local airport was under consideration. I'll wait for that, because the drive to Halifax is over 3 hours.   While on Cape Breton we also played Highland Links and The Lakes. Highland Links was designed by the great architect Stanley Thompson. It and The Lakes are mountainous courses with spectacular water views. Cape Breton is a wonderful golf destination, except for the great distances between courses.",5,positive

Alistair and Pam were very generous and helpful with tips of places to eat and caddies to use. Very nice and comfortable rooms. We had scrambled eggs with French toast and fresh fruit. The Inn is very peaceful and quiet with a great location very close to Cabot Cliffs and Cabot Links golf courses.

If you are staying on the lower (first) floor, then you will hear all the noise and footsteps in the room upstairs (we stayed in room 331). Very irritating if you want a peaceful rest!  -The Nespresso machine was not working and had to be replaced.  -The Fridge did not work and requested to be replaced, but the 'replacement' seemed to be broken as well -Very poor room service, not fully cleaned (looked like it was rushed).  -The staff are not as friendly, and it appears you have to ""book"" them for their service or you end up walking around confused trying to find some answers. Customer service at the Golf course was amazing tho!   When we were checking out, we noticed our bill was MUCH larger than we had calculated and raised the concern, which they advised they ""made a mistake"". Again, very poor customer service!   The panorama restaurant is over glorified because of the view, the food is mediocre but definitely not worth the menu price (pay for the view).

We finally made it happen in early October and we were not disappointed!   The golf was absolutely stunning. The Links course was pure. The greens were rolling true and at a pretty good speed. You can see the ocean from almost every hole!! It was so beautiful, we often forgot we had to hit a golf shot at times! Hole 6 was one of my favourites on Links because of the boats in the harbour, that reminded us of the East coast culture.  Holes 14-16 were also spectacular with the ocean right there! A classic links experience with great flow to the holes, and amazing vistas.   We played Cliffs days 2 and 3... after playing Links we didn't think it could get any better, but WOW Cliffs took it to another level! Each hole had its own character. The par 3 6th is one of the best par 3's I've ever played, with the architecture cut out of the dunes. Holes 15-18 is the best stretch of holes we've ever played. Pictures and words do not do it justice. The staff had warned us about the greens being slow because they were only in their second season of maturation, however after playing a few holes we found the greens to be rolling very true and not as slow as we had anticipated.   The staff including the golf shop, shuttle drivers, starters and guest services were all very friendly and helpful. The Public House had a really cool vibe, with live music and what seemed like a mixture of resort guest and locals.   The accommodations were perfect for what we needed being that we were on a golf trip. The room was spacious and had an amazing view, the sunset from our location on the 2nd floor was beautiful. The bathroom was also spacious and clean, a great bathtub, just what you need after a long day on the golf course. The golf quotes on every door were a unique and light hearted touch.  We also visited downstreet coffee which was a modern coffee house owned by Cabot. They have awesome coffee and lots of choices for breakfast and lunch. It looked like they had flights of beer too!  When my boyfriend was making the accommodations booking he had mention in passing that it would be my birthday during our stay. When we arrived at the lodge there was a bottle of wine from the GM wishing me the happiest birthday, and every time we hopped on a shuttle or popped into buy a drink someone would wish me a happy birthday! Wow did they ever make me feel special!   Cabot is a must on the golfers Bucket List. It is an absolutely magical place. If you have been to Bandon you will enjoy the similarities and will love the unique differences that has made Cabot Cliffs the best in Canada.",5,positive
535807290,data\ca\1841318\3367015\539523453.html,Cabot Links Resort,"This is, perhaps, the most difficult travel review I have ever done. I am most afraid that I will come off as a shill or even a relative of the manager or the ownership group. That being said I think that Cabot is the finest golf resort I have ever been to....and I have been to almost all of the major golf resorts in North America and the United Kingdom.   First to the golf. Both courses, the Links and the Cliffs, are word class. I played the Links in May and the Cliffs in September. The Cliffs is the most memorable course. Many of the holes, particularly on the back nine are forever etched in my memory. To compare the course design to Pebble Beach (and many have) does not do it justice. The Cliffs feels much more like a cross between Cypress, Turnberry, and Royal Portrush. The Cliffs are certainly in my life's top five courses list.  The Cliffs is more of a traditional links course...it has some fine holes which offer great golf but lack the drama of the Cliffs course. It is more comparable to Royal Aberdeen or Portmarnock.   So, the golf is superb but the management and staff is just as good. When I visited in May the Cliffs was not open. Late in the afternoon, after our round on the Links, we were in the Pro Shop and mentioned that we would like to go to the Cliffs course and walk a few holes. The staff gave us directions (the Cliffs is about two miles from the Links) and we drove over. We came across a locked gate about a thousand yards from the course. Just as we were beginning to walk around the gate a vehicle pulled up beside us. It was the General Manager of the Cabot Resort. He unlocked the gate and offered to show us the Links course. He took an hour out of his Saturday evening and drove/walked us around most of the track. That type of service is unheard of...Thank you Andrew!  We stayed in one of the Villas. If you are a group of two couples I urge you to select a Villa. They are large, beautifully designed, and have lovely views of the Links course and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Another special touch from the staff: our ferry to Newfoundland was delayed until the evening of our check out day. We called to ask if we could have a late check out expecting a 1PM or so time frame. Instead the manager on duty said stay as late as we pleased...so we did until around 5PM.  This entire resort exudes class, quality, and thoughtfulness. It is an expensive place but the high value offered makes the expenditure well worth it.  I will return to Cabot Links as least once per year for the rest of my life.",5,positive

It wasn't much more money and we highly recommend this. Our queen suite was excellent, very clean and comfortable with all modern conveniences and we had a private patio attached to sit outside with a glass of wine.

We also don't believe that this place is the best choice for those people who just want one night's accommodation while traveling through. It really is a resort. There is a pool, hot tub, and exercise room and there are canoes, kayaks, paddle boats and bicycles available down by the waterfront. There are also lovely grounds and gardens to wander through. You are paying for all of these even if you just sleep here overnight. We had a glass if wine down by the water and watched many families with children making use of the facilities and enjoying themselves. We found the breakfasts to be great and we ate dinner one night at the waterfront restaurant. The food and prices were comparable to those in nearby Baddeck, neither better nor worse.

After 9pm we gave up and just went to bed.  The double beds were old, worn and the bedding was faded from many washings. The bathroom was also very old and in need of paint and repair. The room had a coffee maker, iron and hair dryer. The furniture was very very old.   The price of the room was over $180/night. Outrageous for the condition of the room.  The lounge was comfortable, prices were reasonable but the service was non-existent. More like serve yourself as the bartender was not gracious and did not greet anyone or deliver their beverages.

Our room was in the main lodge and was quite roomy, very clean, quiet and comfortable with a king bed. From what I read in Trip Advisor, room selection appears to be the luck of the draw. We liked having a sofa in the room for TV viewing, since often there is only one comfortable chair. The AC adequately cooled the room. We liked being able to park outside our room without having to carry luggage up stairs. I opted not to go with a breakfast package but asked for and received a AAA rate of $161 plus tax--a little high for room only compared to other places we stayed during our trip. Check-in went smoothly, and we didn't have any issues with the staff. While my husband used the hot tub, I chose to sit near the lake and read--very pleasant. We ate in the Lakeside Restaurant with a lovely view of the lake. I enjoyed the lobster special while my husband had the pork chops--not outstanding but no complaints. The waitress was attentive. We spent an hour or so in the rather small Thistledown Pub listening to a local folk singer. He was quite good, and we were lucky to get a table. There was no waitress service, but my husband didn't mind ordering at the bar. We ate breakfast in Flora's Dining Room and chose the continental buffet. I was happy to see oatmeal offered and a good selection of muffins, pastries, and fruit. We were there when the dining room opened at 7am, and the young man who waited on us provided timely service since we wanted to catch the 10:30 ferry to PEI. My husband and I agree that this was a good stop for us, and we would not hesitate to stay there again.",4,positive

All I can think of is that the bride and groom in question and their guests were not organized enough and expected the resort to do everything for them. When you plan your wedding at a hotel you are still responsible for planning the event and cannot sit back and wait for it all to be done for you by the staff. It is your day and if you want yours to be as perfect as ours was, take a role in the planning process and it will come off without a hitch.   We were married at the Inverary on October 9th, the day before the wedding in question, and it was absolutely amazing. The weekend and wedding I had always dreamed of. All of friends and family from Nova Scotia, Ontario and the States were all just as thrilled with their weekend as my husband and I were.   We started meeting with the AMAZING event coordinator a year before our wedding and made several trips up the resort throughout the year to touch base with her. When we couldn't be there in person, I emailed with her constantly and she was always able to accomodate my requests. I can't imagine how I would have planned my wedding without her help. She was an invaluable asset who was always happy and willing to meet with me, talk on the phone or answer my emails with the thousands of questions I must have asked her over the course of the year of planning. The day before the wedding when I was running around trying to get everything done I would pop into her office, completely unannounced at least 3 times throughout the day, and even though she had 3 weddings on her schedule that weekend, she was always available to me and I never felt like I was imposing on her.  The weekend of the wedding the planning was handed over to the Day of Coordinator who was just as helpful and professional as possible. Even on the Friday, the day before my wedding, there was another wedding taking place. I would pop down the reception hall to ask her a question about my wedding and even though she had a great deal on her plate getting ready for that night's wedding, she would always more than happily stop and spend time talking to me.   The rooms were stunning, each and every one of them. My husband and I were in 3 different rooms over the 4 nights we stayed there over our wedding weekend and each of the rooms were stunning. All of our guests were thrilled with their rooms as we were. Many of our guests arrived early on both Friday and Saturday and had absolutely no problem checking in early. I did not hear one single complaint from any of my guests or family. The room my bridesmaids and I got ready in was absolutely gorgeous! We were allowed to stay in the room until 4:00, rather than having to check out then check into our room for Saturday night in the middle of getting ready for the wedding. The housekeeping staff could not have been more helpful, bringing extra chairs, mirrors, hand towels....whatever we needed all day. When I was leaving the room just before the ceremony some of them had assembled to watch us leave. I was so touched that they would come back to see us all dressed and ready to go.   All in all, as I said the weekend was absolutely everything we had ever dreamed of. Without the help and support of the amazing staff, I know our weekend would have been perfect. I cannot express my thanks and appreciation to them enough. I know we will be back there to celebrate our anniversary every year.",5,positive

However, we had a pleasant stay. Our room in the main lodge was a little bit dated but large, spotless and comfy with indeed a nice view on the Bras d’Or. Wifi is offered for free but was somewhat erratic with very weak signal at time followed by period of good connection. I do not think that it was due to an overload of the system as we were very early in the season with still a low level of occupancy. We ate at the Lodge restaurant on the first night as we did not feel going to town after a long day and we had a very nice diner so we came back the second nicht this time by choice and no longer by default. The bathroom in our room had obviously be renovated recently and was really nice but I am not sure that it is true for each unit as some parts of the lodge could obviously benefit from some maintenance (for example the paint was badly chipping away on the viewing deck in front of our room). I suspect that is what explain the mixed review but in our case, we had a very pleasant stay at the lodge",4,positive

The towels have probably been in service since the 80's; time for some new ones.  The parking spots are very narrow, not something I'd normally complain about, but I could barely fit our rental car between the lines. Thankfully we didn't wake up to any door dings.   The restaurant at the lodge is quite good. I overhead the kitchen staff talking about that evening's menu, and they seemed genuinely excited about the special. The view again is stunning, but they chose to seat us next to the high-traffic prep station rather than the empty table at the window, which stayed empty the whole evening. The restaurant closes at 10pm, so keep that in mind. Breakfast runs from 7 to 9am, and the buffet is quite good.   There are walking trails on the property, as well as an outdoor pool.

It's a quaint lodge with an ""old-timey"" screen door leading to the balcony walkway that has the view of the lake and some ""character-stains"" in the rugs (nothing too murder-mystery like or anything). That might upset fancy folk, but I liked the 'on the road' vibe I got there, not sure if it was intentional or not though. There is no need to even use the AC because you have a very nice breeze coming in from the water. You have a partial view of the lake if you're situated in the area of rooms 1-20 so ask for a room on the higher level if in that first building on the top of the hill. Sit outside, have a drink and enjoy the view. You can watch the sunrise and great moon light too from there. They have a laundry room and will sell you detergent so you can wash your own clothes, I really liked that too. They provide a very stacked breakfast assortment, so there is definitely something for everyone, and it's a short walk/drive to a bunch of local businesses near the Bras d'or Lake if you want to eat something other than what they provide. You also have a pool behind the lodge, for those hot summer days, but it was way too cool to go in when I got there.  The rooms are very short on available AC outlets so you will notice that very late in the night, you see bathroom lights on, that's likely because they have it on so they can use the AC outlets in the bathroom to charge devices. You get free wifi but will probably need to go to the lobby to get the best signal.",4,positive

We were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the room and the Creature Comforts that it had. The negative aspect of our stay came in the dining. The food was very good, dinner was exceptional however they had 2 Bus full of groups staying and they had priority over the better seats for dinner. The front desk staff helped us with a reservation, however when it came time to sit we had to be placed off to the side upstairs with a limited view from the dining room. Our waitress Penny was lovely, took care of us professionally, and was a delight to work with. Our meals were very good, however we did not experience the same the next morning. We went down for Breakfast early at 7:15am because we wanted to be on the road by 8, and knew they had a buffet that we would take advantage of. We asked to be seat in the Maine dining room, the one that had the beautiful view of the ocean and the grounds. Unfortunately we were told the entire dining room was reserved for the group that was coming in at 7:30. There was no management and either the front desk staff or in the dining room to help us with this problem. We could go to the front desk and try to explain how disappointed we were and basically they were very apologetic but had no control over the dining room staff. So there was no management dining room and there was no management for the front desk for us to go to. We went down and talk to the waitresses and told them we were upset with the fact that we couldn't sit in a room that had absolutely nobody in it have a quick breakfast and get out before they got there. There was no bending of the rules at all. There was no accommodating us other than to tell us we had to sit over in the corner. When I try to apologize to them for being upset with the situation, one of the waitresses told me quote, these people have been booked for months. And if I didn't like the things I should talk to her manager. I was ready to leave, but my husband said let's just sit and eat and get out of here. We did that and when we left we went back to the front desk and Debbie was gracious enough to give us a slight discount on our rooms day, apologize again, but by then the damage had been done, and I was so irritated with the place I just wanted to get out.  I know that this may sound like a petty complaint, but given what we paid for the room and the meals, it would have been nice to be able to sit in the dining room with a good view while we had our meals. So my advice to all who read this and thinking about staying there is as follows, when you make your reservation ask if they have groups in the time that you're staying. I recommend getting the meal deal with your room reservation because it is a good deal for the price. But being treated as a second-class citizen because you're not part of a group leaves much to be desired.",4,positive

I expressed my concern to the hotel and there unfortunately were no rooms available the first night to move to but I was able to move the 2nd and 3rd night. Staying the first night however in the musty room was enough to cause me to have to goto the pharmacy to get sinus medication and I also needed to take Allegra which helped some but not much.

On a separate note, aside from the accommodations for a person allergic to mold, the hotel staff in the PM shift were very helpful in other respects and made sure we had a microwave in our room as well as made sure we were moved to a different room. For all of the headache (Literal and figurative), I do not recommend staying there until the dampness issue is addressed.

I emailed the hotel in advance, explaining the situation to see if accommodations could be made on a day or twos notice. Their response was outstanding: we discovered the bathroom had an elevated seat, along with a handle attached to the tub side next to the toilet.  Even discounting this unusual aspect of our stay, we found the hotel to be a fine place to stay. We were in a below-ground level room facing the parking lot, but we knew about that in advance. Since we were so busy the 3 days we were there, the view would have likely gone mostly unappreciated. The room was large enough, and we appreciated that there were two upholstered chairs in which we could relax. We also liked have two luggage racks - no more piling one suitcase atop the other.

I was absolutely delighted with everything!  When I called to book, the staff member on the phone did a very thorough job explaining the difference between the different accommodations available, the lowest-priced being the regular rooms, the mid-range being the chalets, and the most expensive being the suites in the MacNeil House. I decided to go for a chalet. Excellent choice! It seemed new. Very spacious; I've had studio apartments that were smaller than my side of the duplex was. Fireplace, very comfortable bed, nice clean well-equipped kitchen and bathroom, furniture and braided rugs all in mint condition. I wondered if it would be weird having strangers in the other duplex, but the structures were so spacious and well-built that I couldn't hear a thing from the other side. There is a huge lawn in front of the chalets, and other parties with teenagers were enjoying evening frisbee games there. Other amenities: nice pool and fitness room, bikes to borrow, video games for the teenagers, books to borrow on a bookcase in the lounge, gift shop, computer with Internet access in the lobby, private beach on the Bras d'Or Lake across the street, and a nature trail in the woods out back.  I have special praise for the restaurant. Over the years I have had horrendous meals in hotel restaurants, so I always pass. But this time, after a long day of driving, I decided to go ahead and have dinner there. It was excellent! The buffet had plentiful choices, and if I had wanted a hearty meal, that would have been my choice. I ended up having dinner there every night, I was so pleased with it. I was out sightseeing at other meal times, but wouldn't have hesitated to eat there. A local gentleman sings and plays music of the region and is very good; I was told that he hadn't taken a night off all season, so you can probably count on him being there! (That's him in the photo on the hotel website and brochure.)  And the staff was just outstanding. As a solo traveler, I was so pleased that the restaurant staff remembered me from night to night.

It was a very quiet setting with plenty of room for our party of four, at a reasonable price. Two fairly large bedrooms with very comfortable beds, a large living room and a small kitchen with separate dining area gave us all the space we needed. On the downside, the 2-BR unit requires a couple of flights of stairs; no elevator, so take note if you book this unit. A microwave would have come in handy as well. Lastly, the unit showed some age and in need of a little maintenance, including cleaning the somewhat dirty windows.

Our view out our window was outstanding - we were lucky to have a view of the stream behind the hotel and it was just lovely!   The air conditioner was a bit noisy, but if you didn't turn it on high, it was livable. Even though the bedding was old, the mattress was actually very comfortable.

A bonus is that the motel is across the street from both the local golf course and the cultural centre, which has free access to the internet - handy if you aren't travelling with a notebook or an ipad. It is also a short drive to the Cape Breton Highland National Park - so a good base to use if you want to do some day hikes.  The only minor complaint that we had was that the small table in the room was so low that I couldn't get my legs under it (I'm 5' 5"") so it was a bit tricky to use it for eating breakfast. However, once the rain stopped, we were able to sit outside on one of the picnic tables and enjoyed the view of the ocean - only a few feet away.

The owners are a warm & gracious couple, Guillaume (Bill) and Paulette LeBlanc, who from day one, have made us feel welcome, and at home away from home. We love the 3 room chalets, which give you a sparkling clean kitchen/living area with 2 front facing ocean view windows looking directly out onto the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a full bath, & a queen bedroom suite w/pine furniture. There are 3 sets of windows for fresh sea air, comfortable furniture throughout, remote ceiling fans in living spaces, 2 TV's/ one w/DVD, kitchenette appliances & kitchenware, quality daily housekeeping, & a lovely, well manicured lawn right outside your front door, that walks you up to the sea's edge. We especially love the setup in the living/kitchen area, as the dining table sits in front of the double windows, providing breathtaking views of the Gulf. Besides a stove top in the kitchenette, there is also a gas grill & picnic table right outside your chalet to further enjoy the awesome vista, and lawn chairs right at the sea's edge for comfortable relaxation, plus a nightly bon fire. Additionally, The Ocean View provides a clean, comfortable laundry facility with computer /internet access to use while laundering & a book exchange, all complimentary. In The Ocean View's office, you will find a complimentary CD movie library . In closing, we would like to say The Ocean view's quality accomodations, many amenities and in particular, the LeBlanc's gracious hospitality :), keep us day dreaming the year through in anticipation of next years return to The Ocean View Motel & Chalet's (and Paulette's delicious, freshly baked muffins every morning :) fuel for hiking the Highlands Nat'l Park!!!

We had a king non-view room which actually had a very nice view out over the bay. While the views from the rooms are wonderful I don't know if I would recommend paying extra for a ""view room"" as the windows are small in any case. A very nice breakfast is included in the room price and is served in the Thistle dinning room. Their was live music every evening in the large lounge on the ground floor. The staff, mostly long timers, was friendly and full of information about trails, views, and spots to stop along the Cabot.  While the meals at the Thistle did not measure up those found in the top restaurants in Halifax they were good and reasonably priced. The setting is wonderful with large picture windows looking out on the bays on either side of the lodge.   We did not see the rooms in the newer addition though i can say that they have nice views out over the water from my visit to the health club. The second restaurant on the property which is located in the newer buildings was not yet open - I think it opens up about the middle of June. The fitness center is modest but who exercises in doors when you have trails starting less than 200 meters from the lodge. We did use the pool and the ping pong tables in the fitness center but as it never got above 65 while we were guests I never even stuck my toes in the outdoor pool. Did see a Moose on the golf course one morning but no other large wildlife right around the lodge.  The rooms, at least those we saw, are individually decorated and have a good deal of character. We stayed in 221 which had a Chinese theme and was a fair size with a nice tub to soak in after our long hikes along some of the trails located within a couple of miles of the lodge. As this is an older property their is no elevator in the lodge.  The setting can hardly be beat and for that reason I highly recommend the lodge.",5,positive
84625883,data\ca\499216\186152\112084704.html,Keltic Lodge Resort & Spa,"We stayed at the Keltic Lodge the first weekend of October as part of a ""foodie"" package called Club Fed. As most of the other reviewers have noted, the location of the hotel is fantastic with magnificent ocean views, but the hotel itself is starting to show its age and the rooms are in need of upgrading given the status (and price) of the property. To summarize:  Food: We were on a package deal called ""Club Fed"" which included 2 set course dinners (with wine pairings), breakfast at the buffet, a scotch tasting with appetizers, tour of the kitchen & grounds with the chef, etc. Frankly it was great value (we paid just over $300 / person for 2 nights plus all food, wine, etc), the food was amazing and the chef and all the staff spent lots of time with us making sure we were happy. We'd come back again just for this if they do it again, unfortunately for the hotel (but good for us) only 3 couples booked it so we got lots of personal attention, but not sure if they'll do it again (they should, we'll bring friends next time). One downside, our group was eating in the Purple Thistle dining room (in the main lodge) but I understand it was closed down to other guests and would have been even if the food thing hadn't been happening. We've stayed here before and the food & setting at the Purple Thistle has always been excellent and we would have been dissapointed if we had booked the hotel and couldn't have eaten there. Same thing with the lounge / bar in the main lodge, it was shut down and they were using the other one at the main restaurant a couple hundred feet from the main lodge.  Rooms: Our room had a beautiful view (and was actually the same one we stayed in 2 years ago), but the rooms are in desperate need of updating. Not that you are going to want to spend much time in your room watching TV, but the television in our room for example appeared to be from the 80's and had about 12 channels (of which about 8 were watcheable - the others had too much static). The furniture & beds also seem about 20 or 30 years old at least. If you're not fussy you won't mind, but certainly the rooms need to be addressed or the property will continue to fall further behind. Another pet peeve is that there is no automatic checkout like they have at most hotels these days (there are actual keys for the rooms, not swipe cards) so we ended up waiting in line for about 15 minutes to check out which isn't a great way to leave a property.  Location & Other: The location is very beautiful and there's lots to do in the immediate area if you like the outdoors (there's a great short hike to the end of the point that I would highly recommend). We didn't golf this time, but the Highlands Links golf is fantastic (has been ranked #1 in Canada at times) and can be booked as a package with a stay at Keltic Lodge I believe. We had excellent service from the food staff & front desk, but I would echo another reviewer who said that they sometimes had a hard time getting answers from staff (there was a spa element to our package and we got about 5 different answers about what we could book with it depending on who we asked).

After spending the day driving up the eastern coast of Cape Breton Island, late in the afternoon we decided to see if this hotel had any vacancy, and we did, so we booked a room for Sept 5, 2011. We were quite disappointed. The lodge itself is located in a beautiful spot, overlooking the bay, up high on cliffs and beside the Highland Links golf course. However, it was obvious that is is quite old and in desperate need of renovations and modern updates. We were told by another guest that it is owned by the Canadian government, who is trying to sell it to a private owner, which explained why it seemed no money had been put into it for quite some time.  Our room was not in the main lodge. Maybe the rooms there are nicer than the cottages. We stayed in one of the cottages on the property. When we booked, we had no idea it was a cottage. You walked into a small main area with a few faded couches and old decor, and then there were four rooms per cottage. Our room was actually quite large and even had a fireplace but we had several problems. First of all, the bed was extremely hard and old. My back hurt the next morning! The bedding looked stained and it had seen better days. The air conditioning unit in the window barely worked. During the night, it kept turning off and we would wake up sweating and have to go turn it back on. The windows barely opened because they were wooden and painted. The TV was old and small and cut out constantly. We both had a horrible night's sleep here and felt the price was far too expensive for the room.  However, there were a few positives to our experience. The bathroom in our room seemed to be recently renovated and redone, which was nice. The view from the front of our cottage was also pleasant, it overlooked the bay and the pool area. The pool was really nice too. It was also nice that there are several restaurants on site to eat at, we ate at the less casual one and the food was decent. There are nice walking trails around the Lodge. Highland Links is right beside as well so golfers would enjoy it!   All in all, I would maybe try this hotel again and get a room in the Main Lodge and not a cottage. Worth a try anyways.",3,negative

The hotel is what you can expect from those older resort hotels: wonderful location, well-manicured garden, lots of character, beautiful dining room and sitting room but you have to accept some of the idiosyncrasies of this type of older establishment: sound proofing is not perfect (it was not an issue for us as all the guests were well behaved), small windows which limit what would otherwise be a beautiful view and which leave the room rather dark. Our room (a king size bed with ocean view) was reasonably large with a sofa and a very comfy bed. It had a walking closet or more accurately a storage room which was quite handy to put out of view the many pieces of luggage you end up with when you do long distance trip by car. A few things could be better: you would expect this type of higher end establishment to provide bathrobe for their guest which is not the case, the rod for hangers in the walking closet was located so high that my wife had trouble reaching it and last I do not think that the carpet in the hallway leading to the rooms was ever vacuumed during our stay. There was some pieces of bread crumb or sand in front of our room and in other part of the hallway when we arrived and they were still there when we left.  The Keltic Lodge prides itself in offering a first class dining experience and it is well deserved. We had diner twice in the Purple Thistle Dining Room and once in the Highland Sitting Room.

There is no argument in my mind at it is one of the most spectacular pieces of land on the planet. And breathtaking hiking right off the end of the property that is part of the Highlands National Park.  Having said that, our room, a King ""with view"", was located in the Inn at Keltic building, a short walk from the Main Lodge (the historic structure). The building and common areas seemed to have an institutional feel--think of a hospital or home for the aged that was converted to a resort. The room doors (steel) were painted a semi-depressing light brown, the hallways had this terrible smell (like stale air is the best way I can describe it), and the carpets (at least in the hall and common areas) needed to be replaced. In the rooms, they had done a fairly nice job trying to update what is an older building with newer carpets. Still, the dated feel of the building prevailed. I would opt for either the authentically dated feel of the main building (where a historic feel prevails) or the cottages, which are campy and warm (from what I had seen).  The food was consistently good. The breakfasts, included with the daily rate, were WELL ABOVE average. The bacon was the best I had had (my kids agreed) in many years. The salmon (fresh Atlantic salmon) was the best I had since a British Columbia trip 17 years ago.  Finally, the pub. A nice feel. Great beer selections, decent food offerings, and nightly entertainment (Irish folk music prevailed during our trip) was very good.  We would return....just fine tune it a bit for the MAIN LODGE.

There weren't many other hotels or lodges that visually appealed to us, so it seemed like the only place to stay that fit our needs. I see that others have noted that it is outdated and expensive. I too found it outdated, but it certainly didn't seem overly expensive to me, given that breakfast was included in the room rate.   We would have liked to have stayed in the lodge, but had perhaps booked the inn in error. At first, I was disappointed but in the end I suspect the rooms better fit our needs. The inn definitely needs some kind of better air conditioning and the rooms there were musty. We did have in-room air conditioner units that worked well enough. The views from the room were quite good, but for sure they could have taken more advantage of the location with bigger windows and adding balconies. Perhaps when they renovate they'll keep that in mind? The staff were extremely accommodating and lovely. Everyone was helpful. Servers were a bit slow, but I would come here again. The outdoor pool was a hit too.  We were lucky enough to be guests during KitchenFest and enjoyed flatbreads and beer in the pub while listening to some pretty incredible music. Even the staff couldn't resist tapping their feet while waiting for drinks from the bartender.   If you are expecting a super luxurious stay, perhaps Cape Breton is not the place to stay at all.

It was everything I hoped it would be. For those of you who are not familiar with the Keltic, it is a historic property with what I think is the best view in the world (and we've travelled quite a bit.) It sits high on a rocky peninsula overlooking the ocean from the front and back of the lodge. I read that a friend of Alexander Graham Bell spied the lodge from Smoky Mountain which is across from the lodge and decided to build a home there. The property was later acquired by our National Park and is a national treasure and, for me, the highlight of the Cabot Trail. This is a true resort where you can relax and are entertained every evening in the beautiful ""sitting room"" where they showcase wonderful Cape Breton talent. The two nights we were there, a wonderful singer/guitarist was the featured entertainer - Darrell Keigan - he had an amazing voice and stories to match. He encouraged the audience to sing along and we had a few dances - it was wonderful. Jacklyn checked us in upon arrival and was very welcoming and friendly. We LOVED our room which had a king bed and separate living area. The bed was super comfortable with high quality linens and the rooms had beautiful hardwood floors, wide moldings, and an out-of-this-world view from the windows. The rooms were spotless and the housekeeping staff very attentive. My husband mentioned we were celebrating my birthday when reserving and there was a beautiful birthday card from the staff and some delicious truffles/chocolates waiting for us in the room. What a lovely surprise! Jacklyn called up about 10 minutes after we got to the room to check that all was in order and to ensure we liked the room. That was a nice touch that she checked - showed they care! The same attentive, wonderful service showed up again that evening when we went to the sitting room for dinner and drinks. We had the pleasure of being served by Robert and Andrew - such genuinely nice and very hard working young men. It was busy both nights we were there and they were on the move constantly. Our meals arrived hot and delicious and drinks refilled promptly. Excellent service! We played the ""Highland Links Golf Course"" which is on the property. This course makes you feel like you are a part of the landscape - the course has so many beautiful views and the layout takes advantage of every view. We also hiked the Middle Head peninsula which is a National Parks trail - took us out to the point with more stunning views. My husband and I have never hiked and it was getting later on in the evening (we went after golfing) and I wanted someone to know we were out there. Andrew happened to be going by and so I told him we were going to hike the trail. He assured us we would have time before dark, told us it would take about an hour and a half, and then said to check in with him or be sure to let one of the staff in the sitting room know when we got back so he'd know we were back. It was comforting to know he was looking out for us! The hike was amazing by the way - highly recommend it. We also walked on Ingonish Beach and visited the freshwater lake only a few minutes walk from the beach. There is a lot to see and do within just a few minutes of the lodge. We left wanting more and will definitely be back. Thank you to all who made our visit so memorable and special.",5,positive

The public rooms of the inn were lovely; the main dining room was particularly beautiful with views of the ocean from both sides. We had an excellent evening meal, fine dining, choosing from a varied menu offering many local seafood choices. We had scallops, lobster, salmon and haddock, all prepared well and delicious.

Lastly, with respect to the bathroom, the grout was absolutely FILTHY (I will post a picture when I get a wifi signal). The place felt like a biohazard. Oh, the bathroom also had the scent of urine. A $300+/night biohazard. It was gag-worthy.   The interior finishes and furniture are outdated. The countertop is pink, for example... with a big thick line of WHITE caulk. They obviously did not have skilled craftsmen who cared about their work build this place. They just slapped it together.   The building itself (the inn) is dilapidated. The fence railing behind our room was literally falling apart. There was a dead tree that had fallen over which they just left there to kindly block our $300+/night ocean view. There were no chairs on the porch, making the porch and the alleged ocean view pointless.   The guests across the hall left before us so housekeeping started cleaning their room. This would have been fine if the woman hadn't also slammed the door constantly every time she went in or out while we were still waking up.

Front staff young adults were friendly & welcoming -- willing with advice and answers assuring us that they are there for any need we had or would find. We stayed in the main lodge on the second floor with an ocean and partial property view. We found a comfortable bed, clean bathroom, and spacious closet. A local entertainer in the lounge was part of the last gasp of Celtic Colours activities who engaged with the audience -- a relaxing, pleasant evening after a long day and meal.

Now my own nit-picky observations: Dinner was above average, not gourmet, in the comfortable lounge, but there are only a few dinner tables -- most seating is at low coffee tables which is adequate for appetizers/drinks, but isn't conducive for an entire meal. The salmon I ordered was not served hot, but it was flavourful and well presented. The service was not stellar or even marginally friendly (end of season burnout?) and actually pretty mediocre for the venue. Bar tending was slow and inconsistent in serving amounts -- issues which did not seem to concern our waitress on our behalf.  Breakfast menu options in the dining room were lovely and varied. (A disappointment; Eggs Benedict was served at room temp with dry-firm yolks, but quickly replaced with a proper serving without incident upon request, which speaks to how they handle a minor complaint -- really, it's trivial!) Very cheerful, friendly, welcoming breakfast waitress who took time to engage with us and offer advice about Parks Canada trails to suit our level of activity and interest.   Suggestions?

I won't say it was a big mistake--the hotel was fine--but honestly in any other place this room would be about $99/night. It's only because you have so few options in Cape Breton that they can get away with charging this much.  POSITIVES: Very clean Offers the relative privacy of a hotel (as opposed to a B&B) Friendly staff Huge closet (which made a difference since the room was very small) Pretty nice bathroom  NEGATIVES: Strange jungle-themed room decor Dingy--in desperate need of freshening up (which is not to say it was dirty) Location on the foggier side of the island Very expensive but mediocre food Repetitive breakfast options Cheap bed linens that hardly fit the bed Skimpy on the towels (though more were provided upon request)  Some specific comments: Upon arrival after a long day of travel we decided to eat in the Purple Thistle dining room. The service was very friendly and the dining room is pleasant. But the food was incredibly expensive and really bland. My lamb was tasteless, and my boyfriend's seafood soup looked like a can of Campbell's with some fish stuck in it. The meal was about $150 and we drank very little wine. It was not a good value at all.  Each morning breakfast options were the same--and average or below average in quality. It would seem they could shake things up a bit with the selections.   If I were to return to Cape Breton I think I would stay somewhere with a kitchen. There was a resort in Pleasant Bay that we considered that looked nice and was substantially less expensive than the Keltic. Food in Cape Breton in general is not very good (though we did have great lobster sandwiches in Cheticamp)--perhaps because it is remote and maybe it's hard to get fresh foods (other than fish). Lots of fried things, tons of potatoes and bread. Most of it bland.   I would also stay on the west side of the island. A friend had warned us that the fog on the east side is omnipresent in July, and we certainly found that to be true.

The grounds are lovely, with colorful Adirondack chairs scattered throughout the abundant flowers.

The restaurant is well appointed, and many tables have fabulous views. The large bar area is comfortable, with classy leather furtniture. The rooms are large, some with good views, and the bathromms are updated. The rooms lack the stylish updates, but you don't come all the way to Cape Breton to spend time in your room.

However, we found our King room in the ""Inn"" to be extremely ordinary, though large. The bed was very comfortable and linens had been recently updated. The room itself was badly in need of new paint, carpeting, and a complete overhaul of the bathroom. Other than the new-ish (though very generic) furniture, it screamed 1980. The hall-way leading to our room was dark, dismal, and depressing.   The breakfast buffet at the Purple Thistle dining room was fine. It was a large, though rather ordinary buffet - typical choices of egg, bacon, etc. Nothing unusual or ""gourmet"", but plenty of it. The dining room itself is very gracious and we wished that we could have eaten all our meals there.   We were very disappointed by the Ardan Rum restaurant. The food itself was good (though consistently over-salted), but the service was deplorable. Both nights we ate there, it took far too long for orders to be taken and food to arrive. When I'm paying $30 for an entree, I expect good service. On one of the nights we waited nearly 20 minutes for our drink order to be taken, and then just as long for the drinks to arrive. The soup & salad appetizers took another 10 minutes beyond that to materialize. My water glass went dry and was not refilled.

The beach is great, nice waves and the view of the mountains all around amazing! The hotel restaurant food at the Keltic was not good (perhaps we should not have ordered their special of the day!) but we tried Glenghorm Beach Resort restaurant that is 5 minutes away the food was great.

Great care was taken to ensure the decorated wedding cake was able to withstand the humidity and heat.

However, this is the place to stay in north Cape Breton. The reality is that most of the accomodations in the area are just strip motels or self serve cottages. The Keltic Lodge offers good accomodations with the amenities of a resort (spa, pool, restaurant, lounge, etc.) at a superior location. The resort is set on a little spit of land that juts out into the Atlantic and offers great views from all locations. We stayed at the newer ""Inn"" at the Keltic Lodge. Very much a basic hotel room with a king size bed, loveseat, two chairs and a desk. Room was pretty basic, but bathroom was a bit dated (surprising since this is the ""new"" annex). We were on the second floor and had a great view of the bay and Cape Smokey. The only real complaint about the room was that only one small window opened and I would have really loved more airflow in the room (though, if you went in the heat of summer, the Inn does have A/C and I don't think the main lodge does, though I would confirm that). Nice thing about the Inn is that it is just across the street from the main Restaurant and lounge. You do have to walk up to the main lodge for the breakfast, but it is a short walk and very refreshing int he a.m.. All in all, this is the kind of place I could see going to every year (probably not for us, since we drove 1200 miles to get there, but if you lived in a day's drive, I could certainly see it) and make it a family tradition. Most of the days, we spent out an about in the park, so I didn't have a lot of interaction with the staff or the resort facilities, but I would recommend the hiking trail that starts right a the lodge, it was an easy hike, but offered great views and surprising amount of bald eagles. We ate all three nights at the Ardan Rum restaurant, one night in the main dining room and 2 nights in the lounge. The lounge offers the same menu as the restaurant, but comes with the addition of live music (Cyrill MacPhee was playing and was very enjoyable and I found myself singing along despite the fact I can't sing to save my a**). I couldn't imagine an better way to end the day than a few glasses of wine (maybe some Glen Breton Whisky) and some Fish/Chips, Lobster Pot Pie, Calamari, Blackened Haddock, etc while listening to live music in a very warm and inviting room. Suffice it to say, The Keltic Lodge is an institution and deservedly so, all the staff members were friendly and helpful and the location can't be beat. You won't regret it.",4,positive

My sincere thanks to Sally for extending it by two nights!! I stayed in the main lodge and had a wonderful room. For those of you bent on complaining...they ARE upgrading and renovating the rooms and some of them look really great!! My room was at the end of a hall and I had two scenic views ....one out to the ocean and one of the area behind the lodge and more ocean. The bed in my room was very comfortable with warm clean sheets and blankets...I slept great every night. Each morning I would look forward to looking out the windows at the ocean. My room was spotless clean and kept that way every day by the wonderful housekeeping staff...usually Millie or Torey or a kind Asian gentleman who always wore a smile every time I would encounter them. I never saw a cobweb or any dust anywhere in the room. The shower was great....HOT water and full pressure. Two really useful items in my room that were a nice surprise were the ceiling fan and a huge walk in closet that offered plenty of room for my things. All staff that I encountered during my stay were always very friendly, helpful and had an ever present smile. They really care if you are having a good stay. On one of the evenings they had a great dinner buffet in their Ardan restaurant. Wonderful Prime Rib with demi glaze, potatos, chicken breast, roast pork, shrimp and scallops, mixed vegetables, salad bar and yummy desserts. It was a great meal and my compliments to the chef. Wish I could have thanked hime for i. The new bar area adjacent to Ardan is very nice and in both areas you can gaze out over the views of the ocean to the north. During the rest of the week I had my meals in the traditional Purple Thistle Room in the main lodge.   Each morning there was a wonderful breakfast buffet....they even had a nice lady, Tina who would make a waffle and or custom made omlette for you. She always had a friendly smile. They had so much other food on the buffet you could have a different breakfast every day. The oatmeal is the best I ever had as well as a great multi grain hot cereal called ""Red River"". (I picked up two boxes at Wal Mart in Sydney before coming home...thanks Susan!!). I would like to mention Alice and Sandy the hostesses, Catherine, Susan and of course Eugene the servers...all provided friendly and excellent service for my meals. The last dinner I had was a wonderful Lobster pot pie....just great and a nice Chocolate/Pecan pie that was terrific for dessert. Each evening in the Highland Sitting Room they had live entertainment with Joel the great bartender who would serve you. There was also some nice ladies who worked when Joel was not there. On the grounds there are a lot of hiking trails and by the way this is a SPECTACULAR location....views of the ocean to the north and south...its a ""view like no other"". My thanks also to Barry a nice gentleman who worked on the outside grounds. They have these great colorful Adirondac chairs that I always enjoy sitting in with a good book. The fall foliage was also just terrific to see. Over the years the Keltic Lodge has become a destination for me and it is the best place to stay on Cape Breton. Nowhere on the east coast of either Canada or the United States have I experienced a place like this. I live in Indiana and it is a long journey which includes two different plane flights which I coordinate thru Toronto. Try ""Westjet"" they offer a non stop (seasonal) to Sydney from Toronto....from Sydney it is a two hour scenic drive to the Lodge. Budget rental car sometimes offers a lower rate if you pay in advance online. I was able to get 30% off the normal rate by doing this.

They are clean but sparsely decorated. We could not get into the Keltic Lodge which is where everyone should stay!!! That is a real resort. There are cottages at Glenghorm which looked pretty run down and had people's towels and such hangin all over. Reminded me of a campsite. We did notice that further away they had more modern cottages that looked nice, probably their deluxe properties which might be good. It is on a beach which is rocky. There was a restaurant but we did not eat there. We went to the Keltic Lodge and ate in their bar (restaurant was booked) which had music and was very nice. The food was good there, although we had mostly bar food. When we came back to the lodge, they had some music in their pub. Problem was my 17 year old was not allowed in. I'm sure it's the law but we were allowed into the pub at the Keltic Lodge. Too bad too because the music was really good. Nearby is the Highlands Gold Course which my husband and son played at and loved. My other son and I went whale watching with Ingonish Whale Watching. No whales just dolphins.

At night here is no lighting at the entrance, or on the sign, making it difficult to see. The grounds are beautiful, amazing views of the island, nice calm waters. Amazing sun rises and sunsets.  Cabins- We stayed in a king with a tub. Cabin was great, rustic! Beautiful view, nice breezes flowing through the cabin. The cabin was clean for what it was. Comfortable bed. Dated and dingy comforter and curtains. Would recommend microwaves in the cabins. There is a fire pit on the beach, which we took advantage of.  Restaurant- Beautiful panoramic views. Our waitress was very nice. Décor was dated. Food was terrible! Cold mussels twice, I was so disappointed seeing as they are located so close to the water. I just wanted to get the hell out of there.

The beds are comfortable, and with a restaurant on the premises, it would be easy for travelers not only to have a full stomach but also a great night's sleep as well before heading on the following day.  No one, however, ought to expect great things from the Hearthstone. Though its physical setting is indeed well selected, the rooms are somewhat on the small size. They are also incredibly dark even with every light on, and the walls are quite thin. We were awakened at 6 AM by several truckers next door who were apparently anxious to get back on the road. If one chooses not to eat at the inn, it is about four miles up the highway to the town of Port Hawkesbury and other restaurants and shops. There is no complimentary breakfast; though the home restaurant serves breakfast, it does so at a rather steep premium.

After spending the better part of the day at my son's hockey tournament, at the beautiful Port Hawkesbury Civic Centre, I was looking forward to a nice relaxing stay in the hotel. Needless to say, it was quite disappointing! There was nothing particular that happened to merit a poor review, just the general dreariness of the hotel itself. I realize it is an older property, I've read they are in the process of renos, and maybe I set myself up assuming it would be a little more upscale than it was, given the price paid. The food downstairs was not too bad, albeit a little pricy! I ate at two other restaurants while I was there, one just across the street & one in the plaza by the banks and both of their menus had more variety, lower prices & food that was just as good if not better than the hotel's. Let me be clear, I'm not being cheap. I don't mind paying big money for a nice supper, but I don't like overpaying for a mediocre dinner because the restaurant owner/mgmt. have a false notion that they are serving high-end food in high-end environment. Advance apologies if I'm wrong about this, but that's the impression I get from this place.   The pool area was very nice and setup to make it easy to either sit, stand or walk around the deck to watch the children. When you have big groups of children all swimming at the same time, it can be nervewracking but I found there was lots of room around the deck and you could actually watch the kids' without getting soaked! I have to say my only complaint about the pool area was the fitness centre located adjacent to it (the pool and fitness centre are separated by a glass wall and door). I found it very strange that the treadmills in the gym are set up in such a manner that they are facing the pool. My teenage daughter was quite uncomfortable swimming, as she thought she was being watched by the man on the treadmill. Personally, I'm not so sure he was watching her, I think he just had no choice but to look in that direction. Either way, she left centre and came back to the room. Why they don't have the equipment facing the other way is beyond me, it gives the place a real creepy vibe!  So, on the plus side 1. The staff was phenomenal; despite the busy weekend they strived to make sure you had what you needed. 2. I saw that the canteen at the Civic Centre was ran by Maritime Inn's restaurant, and was really pleased with the quality and service of the arena snacks and beverages. More variety than your typical deep fried arena staples! The lady with the glasses was really nice and treated the kid's very well, when most people would have lost their patience with them! 3. Rooms weren't fancy (outdated, really), but you can tell housekeeping, maintenance took pride in their work, as everything was clean and in working order.  I guess as my rating and title suggest, this place is very mediocre. There are no other hotels in PH, so this is as good as it gets! I dare say that if somebody had the money and gumption to put a modern mid rate hotel up in the town, Maritime Inn would probably being boarding up its windows, unless it made some big changes!",3,negative

We had a premier room, 2 double beds, and a small sitting area, along with a bar fridge, a balcony and a nice size bathroom. The room could be compared to any quality hotel you'd stay at in Halifax. As a hotel who have been undergoing renovations for a while now, they are doing an exceptional job. The pool is spacious, and the children enjoyed many trips there. We also ordered food from Millers Tap & Grill, their ""pub"" on site, and we all enjoyed the pizza and finger foods. Check in & out was quick and courteous, with the clerk offering much information on the hotel. We also had breakfast in the main dining room, and it was delicious. Try the french toast served with blueberry syrup and whip cream! Overall, a wonderful experience. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Maritime Inn to anyone travelling to Port Hawkesbury.

The owners run a very efficient operation. The sites are well-spaced - this has been a challenge in some campgrounds in Nova Scotia. The property itself overlooks Aspy Bay so the views are beautiful. In the office, you can also get fresh seafood which is a nice treat. TRY THE OYSTERS! They are briny and the perfect size. At $2.00 a piece they are slightly less than I've seen elsewhere in the Maritimes and are harvested by the owners own farm in the bay. Everyone is very helpful in suggesting day trips from the camp. The location is about midway on the Cabot Trail, so perfect to use as a base. There is a store very close to the camp, and the camp office has a good stock of basics. Will be back.",5,positive

It was not really special, but had a rugged rec hall to hang out. The showers/washrooms were clean and plenty of space. The owners were friendly. The location was close enough to town to get some ice cream after dinner.",4,positive

Cabins are very basic (but new) but the view on the top part of the campground is amazing so ask for it. Owners are very friendly and helpful. Would definitely return.",4,positive
